Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes, primarily affecting older adults. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases globally. The disease progresses in stages, starting with mild memory impairments and eventually leading to severe cognitive and functional disabilities. Early detection is crucial as it allows for timely interventions, which can slow progression, improve the quality of life, and provide a longer window for planning care. Predicting Alzheimer’s progression through machine learning is vital to identifying individuals at risk early, understanding the key factors influencing its development, and enabling data-driven, personalized medical strategies for better outcomes in managing this condition.
